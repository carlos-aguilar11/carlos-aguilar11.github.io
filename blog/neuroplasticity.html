              <span class="c4"> What is Neuroplasticity?</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change and reorganise
              itself on a cellular level as the result of our interactions with
              our environment, behaviour, and internal experiences. This ability
              is what allows our brain to rewire and reorganise itself, both in
              structure and functionality.
            </p>
            <p>
              You may think that everything sounds quite obvious, well,
              understanding the principles of neuroplasticity helps your brain
              to do these changes in a faster and more efficient way.
              Understanding how your brain works and how you can improve it,
              benefits your learning capacity and make pathways formed in your
              brain and its connections much stronger.

              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Some of the benefits of neuroplasticity have been defined by
              different experts and we could resume them as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="c5">

                  abilities,helping you learn new skills or enhancing existing

              </li>

                >

            </ul>
            <p>
              How can I apply all of this to my personal journey of learning? I
              think one of the most common enemies of somebody who is learning a
              new skill is themself, this is well-known as the impostor
              syndrome. Knowing the principles and benefits of neuroplasticity
              gives me the certainty that my brain is capable of learning and
              improving itself, rewiring new neuro-paths and has the ability to
              adapt and enhance in different areas.
            </p>
            <p>
              But, understanding neuroplasticity and how your brain works won’t
              be enough, you need to do some changes in your lifestyle if you
              really want to reach your full potential. Some of the ways to
              improve it are:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <span class="c5"> Improve your environment,</span>
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <span class="c5">
                  Stimulate your brain with new activities,</span
                >
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <span class="c5"> Exercise regularly,</span>
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                <span class="c5"> Play games and activate your brain,</span>
              </li>
              <br />
              <li><span class="c5"> Get plenty of rest, and</span></li>
              <br />
              <li><span class="c5">Practice Mindfulness</span></li>
            </ul>

          <div>
            <p>
              <span class="c4">Growth Mindset</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              A growth mindset is simply the belief that you can improve your
              abilities through strategies, effort and determination. In
              contrast, fixed mindset establishes that intelligence, talent and
              any other human qualities are unchangeable.
            </p>
            <p>
              The term was mentioned for the first time by American psychologist
              Professor Carol Dweck in her book Mindset: The New Psychology of
              Success, 2006. Her exploration and studies show that those who
              have a growth mindset, meaning they believe that they can develop
              their talents and capabilities, tend to achieve more than those
              with a fixed mindset.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having a growth mindset, helps you to see more opportunities to
              challenge yourself to improve your talents and develop different
              skills. Understanding this concept, blending it with your
              understanding of neuroplasticity and applying all this new
              knowledge to your learning plan will be fundamental to achieving
              your full potential.
