              I always like to set short and medium-term goals. I feel like they
              are more achievable and they help me to focus and go step by step,
              instead of getting lost in the final goal. Of course, finishing
              the boot camp and starting a job in tech or coding would be my
              short-term goal, but soon after that, I want to be a professional
              web and app developer.

              In any context that involves any kind of relationship, working,
              studying, or socialising or every time I’m part of any new group
              of people, I always try to grow in empathy, synergy and respect,
              and I would love to use this opportunity to do the same.

              I’m going to do my best using my strengths not just only to help
              my own career development, but also to be available and help
              anybody who needs me. Being proactive, organized and respectful.
              Always work as a team and be in constant communication. I will
              also keep working on my limitations, and improving every day so
              they don’t affect me or any of my peers. If I’m feeling
              overwhelmed or not finding the inspiration to get things done, I
              will always take a step back, try to look at the problem in a
              different way and if I need it, ask for help.

              I don’t consider myself a ‘stressy’ person, I always try to see

              I’m not coping with something I will always reach for help. The
              only thing I expect from the Facilitation team is respect and
              availability.

            <p>
              As I mentioned in my original plan, I usually prefer to set short
              and medium-term goals. My goal after finishing the course is to
              grow my skills to become a web and app developer. I’d like to
              create new and innovative applications, I’d love to work on
              finding needs in society that could be fulfilled with these tools.

            </p>
            <p>
              The biggest strengths I have and could be fundamental at Bootcamp
              are my ability to work as part of a team and my empathy. On the
              other hand, my biggest weaknesses that I need to keep working
              through this part of the course are my need to fix everything and
              my self-discipline, a limitation that I’ve been working on
              successfully during Foundations but still needs improvement.

            </p>
            <p>
              I think having to stick to the time suggested to finish a task or
              “timebox” and maybe having to talk in front of a large group of
              people in my “second language” are going to be my biggest
              non-technical challenges during Bootcamp.

            </p>
            <p>
              I would like to keep working on the same human skills I mentioned
              previously in my original plan, but I would like to also work on
              two extra aspects:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                My<span class="c5"> patience.</span> I feel like when it comes
                to big ideas and complicated projects I’m super patient in
                explaining every little detail, but when is about tasks or
                things that my brain perceives as basic and simple I don’t have
                the same tolerance.
              </li>
              <li>
                I’d also like to improve my
                <span class="c5">communication skills</span>, again, as English
                is my second language I don’t have the same confidence to
                communicate with large groups of people as I do in my mother
                tongue, Spanish.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <div>

                What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              I expect to be supported and patiently listened to. One of the
              reasons I choose this cohort instead of the online version was
              because I feel that being there next to the facilitators would
              give me the chance to reach out easily when I need it and it would
              allow me to communicate in a more effective way.
            </p>

            </p>
            <p>
              I’m going to do my best working as part of a team. I’m going to
              improve my self-awareness and empathy and used them for my own
              growth and to help my team's development. I’m going to be
              proactive, respectful and always try to communicate efficiently
              with everyone. I will always be there if somebody needs me and if
              things feel overwhelming for me, I’ll always try to find calm,
              refresh my ideas, have a break and ask for help when I need it.

            Tā Mason Durie’s Te Whare Tapa Whā is a metaphor based on four

            pillars helps us balance our hauora and support others to balance
            theirs, too.
