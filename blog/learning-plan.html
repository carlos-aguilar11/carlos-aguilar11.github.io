            <p>
              I always like to set short and medium-term goals. I feel like they
              are more achievable and they help me to focus and go step by step,
              instead of getting lost in the final goal. Of course, finishing
              the boot camp and starting a job in tech or coding would be my
              short-term goal, but soon after that, I want to be a professional
              web and app developer.

              In any context that involves any kind of relationship, working, studying, or socialising or every time I’m part of any new group of people, I always try to grow in empathy, synergy and respect, and I would love to use this opportunity to do the same.

            <p>
              I’m going to do my best using my strengths not just only to help my own career development, but also to be available and help anybody who needs me. Being proactive, organized and respectful. Always work as a team and be in constant communication. I will also keep working on my limitations, and improving every day so they don’t affect me or any of my peers. If I’m feeling overwhelmed or not finding the inspiration to get things done, I will always take a step back, try to look at the problem in a different way and if I need it, ask for help.

            </p>
            <p>
              I don’t consider myself a ‘stressy’ person, I always try to see different perspectives on any issue in order to resolve it. But, I’m not afraid to ask for help when I need it, so if I feel like I’m not coping with something I will always reach for help. The only thing I expect from the Facilitation team is respect and availability.

              Nope, everything is sorted out. The only thing I have going are physio appointments, but I always plan them with anticipation.
