            <p>
              The core subjects of the foundations part of the course gave me a
              better understanding of myself and how to improve my development
              in this new career. Gave me a better understanding of my emotional
              intelligence, thought me how my learning can improve with the
              right focus on my strengths and weaknesses and provided me with
              many tools to make my work easier and more effective.

              They are intrinsically connected aspects of our EQ and they are
              fundamental in learning and programming, as they should be in any
              aspect of our life. Our values are the boundaries of our actions
              and if we are self-aware and empathic, we would be able to
              understand our own and other people's thoughts, beliefs and
              feelings. These skills would give us the ability to:

                <span class="c5">Self-reflection:</span><span class="c7"> Reflect our own
                thoughts, feelings and manners would help us gain an
                understanding of our own actions and would lead us to
                self-improvement and personal development.</span>

                <span class="c5">Empathy:</span><span class = "c7"> Understanding our own emotions
                would help us to recognise similar emotions in others. Being
                able to see and understand other people’s perspectives would
                lead us to better relationships and more effective
                collaboration.</span>
              </li><br>
              <li>
                <span class="c5">Better communication:</span><span class = "c7"> Having
                self-awareness and empathy would able us to communicate our
                feelings and needs effectively, in a clear and assertive way.</span>
              </li><br>
              <li>
                <span class="c5">Improved decision-making:</span><span class ="c7"> These skills
                would also allow us to make better decisions when we face a
                problem because we would have a better understanding of
                ourselves, the other people involved and the whole situation.
                Our decision would be aligned with our and other people’s values
                and needs.</span>

            </ul>
            <p>
              In recap, developing these skills would make a huge difference in
              our learning and programming journey, it would help us to handle
              challenging situations, to understand our strengths and
              weaknesses, and other people's perspectives and needs.

                What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</span

            </p>
            <p>
              In my experience working in teams and leading work groups, I’ve
              always tried to apply many of the things we’ve seen during
              the core chapters of Foundations. But I was very and pleasantly
              surprised by all the evidence and studies about neuroplasticity
              and growth mindset. I found the concepts so interesting and
              relating them to other aspects of emotional intelligence gave me
              some amazing insights.
            </p>
          </div>

              <span class="c4">
                What were the most challenging aspects of the core
                learning?</span
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              I think that being self-aware is always hard, it obviously doesn’t
              have the same intensity for everyone, but being totally aware of
              your capacities and disadvantages and knowing yourself at the
              deepest level can be tricky not only to achieve it but also to
              manage it.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>
              <span class="c4">
                Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much
                time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp
                course?</span
              >

              Because scientific evidence has shown us how important is the
              development of EQ in any person and how people with high levels of
              EQ achieve significantly better results in every aspect of their
              life. We know thanks to those analyses that developing as a
              programmer with high levels of emotional intelligence would give
              us skills to solve problems, communicate and collaborate as part
              of a team in a more efficient way.

                Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
                waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise
                programming instead? Justify your answer.</span

            <p>
              Not at all! I think that all the subjects we’ve seen during the
              core part of Foundations are as relevant as the coding techniques
              we learnt. I can’t emphasise enough how important is to develop
              your emotional intelligence and how fundamental this can be to
              becoming a better programmer and a better person in general.
