              Just to set a bit of context, back in my home country I used to
              work as a casino supervisor/manager. One time (around 11 years
              ago), a friend of mine was involved in an illegal activity related
              to her job as a croupier (casino dealer). After the situation was
              discovered I decided to cut her off from my life and we never went
              back to being friends. I wasn’t upset about her doing something
              illegal, my conflict was that she did it while many of her friends
              were working there and her actions could have caused major
              problems for other people, and that lack of empathy in a situation
              that could have changed people’s lives, in a really bad way, I
              just couldn’t bear it. Today I still feel the same way, my values
              have evolved but are still pretty much based on the same
              structure, so when I look back I still think it was the right
              thing to do.

              I definitely owe my values to my parents. My mum is a very ethical
              and strong woman, who is also religious, and she was always
              teaching me and my siblings to be empathic, honest and fair. My
              dad is a self-raised man, he started to work when he was 7 years
              old and never stopped. Even though he worked most of the time, he
              was always there for us and he taught us to be persistent,
              motivated and hard workers.

              I consider myself an honest, empathic, organized and kind person,
              with a good sense of humour. I think my values will help me to
              work through the course as part of a team, and this learning
              journey will help me evolve and teach me more than just coding.

              Two things that have been a problem in the past and I’ve been
              trying to improve during this course are my lack of
              self-discipline and the need to fix everything on the way. They
              still show up sometimes, but as I go, I’m learning to prioritise
              tasks in order to get the job done as best I can.

                your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and

            <p>
              I remember when I was at Uni, I decided to do my thesis with my
              group of friends. We were quite a smart group and very
              competitive, but three of them tended to take the “competition” to
              the next level. So every time we had to take big decisions
              regarding the investigation approach, perspective, and division of
              roles, we always hit a wall and took us forever to get to a
              conclusion. They always wanted to do the best part or in other
              words, they always thought they could do better than others. At
              one point we were running out of time and things were getting
              tight, So I decided to take action and just make the decisions. I
              explained my argument, and they agreed and we divided our roles
              giving them reasons why we would work as we did.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think my approach today to the same situation would be a bit
              different, because even though the plan succeeded, I based it on
              the “trying to get things done” approach, without worrying about
              the learning experience. That meant, that we all knew our subject
              to the point to sound like expert professionals, but we only
              touched base on the subjects that the others had worked on, and
              that could have been catastrophic in a different scenario. So
              today, I wouldn’t wait until the last minute to speak, I would try
              to learn as much as I can about all the subjects of my project and
              I would try to motivate and help the other members of my group to
              do their best and achieve their goals.
