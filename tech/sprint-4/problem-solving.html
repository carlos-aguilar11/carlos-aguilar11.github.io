          <p>
            I got stuck doing the superFizzbuzz challenge and although it wasn’t
            an easy task, after spending so much time trying to solve it using
            different techniques, I left it unfinished, took a break and started
            doing another challenge. Then I went back, with my last inch of hope
            and checked my code one last time before I asked for help and I
            realised that I misspelt the word length inside the function.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before, that little moment of excitement, I researched the hell out
            of it on every imaginable website, thinking there was something
            wrong with my syntax. I also checked the tech channel, used
            pseudocode to read step-by-step what I was trying to do and checked
            the error messages, but obviously, nothing worked. Until I decided
            to have a break, put my mind to something else, went back and ta-da!
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a bit frustrated that I couldn’t see the problem, found
            examples that were literally like my solution but: Why is my one not
            working!? Then once I noticed my “little” - but hugely annoying -
            mistake the feeling was a mix of relief and satisfaction with
            feeling like an idiot for not seeing it earlier.
          </p>
          <p>
            I learnt that sometimes I focus too much in the things that I don’t
            understand or I’m not used to. For example in this case, I checked
            everything about my code thinking that something was wrong in my
            syntax and also I checked the spelling of my variables, parameters
            and any other element, without thinking that the mistake could be in
            a simple misspelt of a word that I’m more used to read and type.
          </p>
          <br />

          <div>
            <p><span class="c3"> Elegantly solving a problem</span></p>
            <p>
              As part of the JavaScript Kata, we were asked to search for
              certain methods and functions for each challenge. So in the
              capitalize challenge, we had to use the “.map” function, which was
              totally new for me. So, I did what I normally do and search the
              hell out of it on every single website that Google suggested and I
              couldn’t find exactly what I was looking for.
            </p>
            <p>
              We had to
              <a href="http://surl.li/gmqhq" target="_blank"
                ><span class="c3">map</span></a
              >
              over every word of a sentence inside a
              <a href="http://surl.li/gmqjh" target="_blank"
                ><span class="c3">string</span></a
              >
              and every piece of information that I found was about using it to
              change letters from <a href="http://surl.li/gmqla" target="_blank"
              ><span class="c3">elements</span></a
            > but inside an <a href="http://surl.li/gmqlo" target="_blank"
            ><span class="c3">array</span></a
          >. <span class =c3>(</span> Do you see
              those thick words in this paragraph, if you don’t know what they
              mean, hover over each of them and you can find a link.<span
                style="font-size: 20px"
                >&#128521;</span
              ><span class =c3>)</span>
            </p>
            <p>
              After the experience in the superFizzbuzz fiasco, I quickly
              thought: “Ok, I don’t think this is helping, I’m gonna split the
              problem, search for each individual thing that I need to do to
              solve it and translate it to code”. So basically, I used
              pseudocode, the search engine, reflecting, etc. And it worked on
              the first try.
            </p>
            <p>
              This time the feeling was different. I felt pretty awesome that I
              could sort the solution out so quickly and gave me great pleasure
              to see my code so clean and simple. This basically was like using
              my own previous experience to do things in a different way,
              getting the same result but more efficiently and faster.

                    use it a lot, but sometimes I feel it’s a bit messy so I
                    tend to delete it once I reach my goal.

                    pretty confidente with the technique of trying new things,

                    using it but I only do it when I’m really stuck and I can’t
                    understand what I’m trying to do.

                    fix the issues, but when the problem is complex or comeback
                    undefined! I can’t work out how to solve it. I guess it’s
                    just the lack of experience.

                    only used it in pretty basic tasks and in that case, I’m
                    super confident. But, I think I have to keep learning about
                    the benefits of this tool in more complex scenarios.

                    experiences solving problems during the Javascript-Kata
                    challenges, this process is the one I use the most and I’m
                    pretty confident with it. I could say that I’m quite good at

                    Super confident on this one, but I prefer to ask directly to
                    somebody instead of searching for general help. I feel it’s
                    easier - at least for me - to identify who could help me and
                    ask for it, than just randomly asking and then getting too
                    much information.

                    really personalized and it gives me a good way to receive
                    other perspectives from someone with much more experience

                    thinking about what I’ve learned during the day. I also
                    enjoy going back and seeing how I did the tasks I was asked
                    to do. I must say though, sometimes when I check my work -
                    and I guess this happens to almost everybody - I can’t
                    explain, or even worst, I can’t understand how I did what I
                    did to get the final result.

          <p>
            I haven’t, but I do prefer to ask - as I mentioned before - directly
            somebody who I feel could help me. In general, I’m pretty confident
            to say something if I don’t understand and asking for help when I
            need it. I think the only time that I hold my intentions of asking
            is when I push myself, convincing me that I can do things on my own,
            but as part of this process of improving our learning techniques,
            I’ve been pretty good at letting things go when is necessary.
