            <p>
              Think about your favourite food, and imagine that you want to cook
              it for your family. So, its base ingredients would be the HTML of
              your recipe. The different extra things you want to add to it, to
              make it taste the way you like, the spices you want to use, those
              my friend would be your CSS. And finally, the stove, the oven, and
              all the cookware that allows you to play with the ingredients,
              changing their shape and texture, or the cutlery that allows your
              family to interact with your food and change its shape, all of
              that would be the Javascript.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p><span class="c3"> Control flow, functions and loops</span></p>
            <p>
              Control flow is basically the order in which the computer executes
              instructions from top to bottom in a script.
            </p>
            <p>
              Functions are one of the most fundamental building tools in
              Javascript, they are like automated orders that you create, so
              every time you use them your computer does what you expect. They
              are very helpful, as they can be used multiple times.
            </p>
            <p>
              And loops are a sequence of these instructions that is continually
              repeated until a specific condition is reached.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know it may sound confusing, so let’s try to explain it with
              something more familiar. Let’s say you are the kind of person who
              showers every day - doesn’t matter if you are not, the example
              would work anyway, I’m not judging by the way -. Ok, so the normal
              process of a shower, taking away all the extra things you like or
              may need to do before, is like turning on the extractor/fan,
              getting in the shower, turning on the water, shampoo, soap, rinse,
              dry.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, the process of having the shower, starting by turning on the
              extractor is like the control flow of a program. It goes from top
              to bottom in that order, you wouldn’t dry before you rinse
              yourself, or you wouldn’t rinse before you use shampoo or soap,
              that’s basically that idea.
            </p>
            <p>
              The action of having it, saying to yourself: “Ok mate, I think we
              need one!”, the showering perse, that would be the function, it
              allows this process of having a shower to run from one point to
              the end. And there is where loops are used, they tell this
              function to end at a certain point. The loops basically stop you
              from jumping again in the shower and doing the function over and
              over again, you wouldn’t shower again just after you dried
              yourself, well maybe if you had an “accident”, but as I said
              before, I’m not judging.
            </p>
            <p>And it would look like this in your Javascript document:</p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/shower-function.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p></p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/shower-log.png" /></div>
            <br />
          </div>
          <div>
            <p><span class="c3">The DOM</span></p>
            <p>
              The term DOM stands for Document Object Model and is basically an
              object representation of your HTML document, it defines its
              structure and allows programmers to access and manipulate the
              elements inside of that HTML document. It's commonly seen as a
              “tree structure” (see the picture).
            </p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/dom.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p>
              I know it doesn’t sound simple, so let’s take back the first
              example on this blog. Do you remember you were cooking your
              favourite meal? Well, let’s establish that your dish is your
              website, the main ingredients are your HTML, your spices and extra
              ingredients are your CSS, and all the utensils and cookware are
              your JavaScript.
            </p>
            <p>
              So, how can we explain the DOM with that example, simple, the DOM
              would be your kitchen, it gives you access to all the tools that
              allow you to manipulate and create your meal. Is the space where
              you can create and taste and if anything goes wrong you put it on
              the rubbish and start again.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p><span class="c3">Arrays and Objects</span></p>
            <p>
              Although they are both sort of storage tools that you can use in
              Javascript to store, access and modify information (values). they
              are different.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can use Arrays to store multiple data, like a list of things.
              Let’s take back the last example from the DOM, let’s say you have
              your list of ingredients, they would look like this in your
              JavaScript file:
            </p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/ingredients.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p></p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/ingredients-log.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p>
              And let’s say you don’t have cornstarch and you want to replace it
              with tapioca, so we are going to manipulate the value inside the
              array:
            </p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/swap-ingredient.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p></p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/swap-ingredient-log.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p>
              In the other hand, objects are used to represent a “thing” inside
              your code. If you want to save some information about something
              you would use an object. Following the same example, let’s say you
              want to specify some information about your ingredients.
            </p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/product-object.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p></p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/product-object-log.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p>
              Then you want to change part of the value because you got the name
              of the brand wrong:
            </p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/product-swap.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p></p>
            <br />
            <div><img src="/images/Sprint 3/product-swap-log.png" /></div>
            <br />
            <p>
              So, that would basically be the difference between them. 
             </p>
             <p> 
              Hope you enjoy all the material and that it was easy to understand the concepts.
