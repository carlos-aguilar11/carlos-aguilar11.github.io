        <div class="box3">
          <span class="c2">Class vs Id. Which one should you use?</span>
          <p>
            Classes and IDs are both element selectors and their function are to
            identify an element based on the assigned parameters. The difference
            between them is that Class can be applied to a group of HTML
            elements on a single page and ID is applied only to one HTML
            element.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you are starting your journey of learning to code, it's hard to
            identify when to use Classes vs IDs. I feel like there isn’t a wrong
            choice and you can easily use one or the other as they are very
            similar. So the way I wrap my mind around it is by thinking about
            which option is going to give me a better and clearer workspace.
            But, you could just think of what you want to achieve with this
            selector, changing one specific element, many, changing part of one,
            combining them together, the options are many.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best way to understand them and how to use them is with
            examples, so let’s say we have this basic HTML document.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-01.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>And it would look like this on our website:</p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-02.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Let’s add the same attributes to our 'h1' and our first paragraph
            'p'. All we have to do is add the same class to both tags. Like
            this:
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-03.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Then, we add the selector class to our CSS file, always starting
            with a dot.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-04.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>And now our website is looking like this:</p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-05.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            But now we decided that, even though we want to keep that class for
            our paragraph and maybe use it in other elements, we want to give
            our ‘h1’ some specific attributes. So we add an id inside our ‘h1’
            tag.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-06.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Then we add the id selector to our CSS, which by the way starts with
            a #.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-07.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>Now, our website is looking a bit different.</p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-08.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Basically, that’s what you can do with each of them, but the awesome
            thing is that you can mix them up and use them together.
          </p>
          <p>
            Let’s say we want to keep our initial class (.start) for our 'h1'
            and first paragraph 'p', but we want to add a few extra attributes
            to our 'h1'. Then we can use both selectors separated in our HTML
            document just by one space.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-09.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            Then we can change our id in our CSS file and add the attributes we
            want to have exclusively in our 'h1'.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-10.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>And now our website looks like this:</p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-11.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            As I said you can mix them up, but you can also use 2 classes
            together in the same tag. So, let’s say we want to keep the basic
            attributes we already have, but we want to add extra attributes to
            our first paragraph 'p'. First, we add a new class to our tag, in
            this case, it’s called border1, but you can name it however you
            want.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-12.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>Then we add the class selector to our CSS file. Like this:</p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-13.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            So now, after we added those classes and id selectors, our HTML and file looks like this:
          </p>
          <br />
          <div>
            <img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-14.png" />
            <br>
            <p>
              ... Our CSS file like this:
            </p>
            <br>
            <img
              src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-15.png"
            />
          </div>
          <br />
          <p>
            And finally, now our website is looking a bit different again and that was
            exactly what we wanted.
          </p>
          <br />
          <div><img src="../../images/Sprint 2/class-id-16.png" /></div>
          <br />
          <p>
            I hope these examples help you to understand the difference between
            class and id, and gave you a better idea about when and how to use
            them.
